# Photo Gallery

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create a basic webpage to display photos in a gallery view, using an `API` such as **Flickr** for photos.

For more information on the `API` from Flickr visit the link below.

```

A link to the webpage that I made can be found in the **About** section of this repository or below.

For the **Original** Gallery that uses `JSON` data for photos visit the link below.
